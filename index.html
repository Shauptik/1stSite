            Whenever you are harmed and cheated by someone in your life,
            don't ever think of taking revenge from that person.
            Instead of that make yourself Calm and do the things that make you perfect,
            later on in the stages of life the person who had hurt you will
            regreat for their mistakes and will think what they have lost.
